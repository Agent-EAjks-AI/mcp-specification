Since its open source release in November 2024, the Model Context Protocol project has grown faster than we could have ever imagined. That's a wonderful problem to have, but with growth come growing pains. Our existing processes, which worked well for a small team, have started to show their limits.

Today, we're taking a big step to ensure MCP can continue to grow and thrive. We're introducing a formal governance model designed to bring clarity to the development process while preserving the collaborative, open source spirit that has made MCP successful.

## Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)

One of the first major changes we're introducing is [Specification Enhancement Proposals](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (SEPs). This will be the primary mechanism for anyone to propose changes to MCP. If you're familiar with Python's PEPs or Rust's RFCs, you'll feel right at home. The process is very straightforward:

1. Following the [SEP guidelines](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines), submit a proposal as [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) to start the conversation.
2. Find a sponsor from the steering group, either on [Discord](https://discord.gg/modelcontextprotocol) or [GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol). Refer to [`MAINTAINERS.md`] for a list of currently active maintainers and their focus areas, as well as their preferred contact information.
3. Work with the sponsor and the MCP community to move your proposal through draft, review, and implementation stages.

SEPs provide a clear, documented path for evolving the protocol, ensuring that every major change is well-vetted by the community.

## A Structure for Sustainable Growth

The new model also establishes three types of leadership roles, ensuring both focused ownership and broad community representation:

- **Maintainers**: The frontline of the project. They manage specific components like SDKs, our documentation, and individual repositories.
- **Core Maintainers**: The strategic leaders. They guide the overall direction of the project and the evolution of the MCP specification.
- **Lead Maintainers**: The project's stewards. They serve as the final decision-makers and ensure the project's long-term health.

All maintainers form the **MCP steering group**. To ensure a structured and timely review of incoming proposals, our core and lead maintainers will meet bi-weekly to review submitted [SEPs](#specification-enhancement-proposals-seps). Meeting notes and decisions will always be public.

## Get Involved

We need your help to build the future of MCP. No matter your skill level or area of interest, there's a way to contribute!

- **New Contributors**: The best way to get started is by helping us with documentation, fixing bugs, or building out examples. Every contribution matters, and we are here to help you make your first one.
- **SDK Developers**: As MCP expands, we need help building and maintaining SDKs for new languages and ecosystems.
- **Documentation Writers**: Clear, comprehensive documentation is what turns a good project into a great one. Help us improve our guides, tutorials, and API references.
- **Future Maintainers**: We believe in promoting from within. The path to becoming a maintainer starts with consistent, quality contributions and a commitment to the project's success.

The MCP community is growing, and we want you to be a part of it. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/modelcontextprotocol) to connect with other contributors, ask questions, and find mentorship. Whether you're fixing a typo or proposing a major change to the protocol, you are welcome here.
