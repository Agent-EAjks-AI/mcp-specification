title: Contributor Communication
description: Communication strategy and framework for the Model Context Protocol community
---

This document provides practical guidance for communicating and collaborating within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) project.
It outlines the communication channels, workflows, and processes used by the MCP community.

## Communication Channels

We support three primary communication channels - the public Discord server, [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues), and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions) in the [main project repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol).

### Discord

For real-time contributor discussion, support, and collaboration. The server is designed around **MCP contributors** and is not intended
to be the place for general MCP support.

**How to use:**

- Join discussions in topic-specific channels
- Share updates and collaborate in development channels
- Follow community guidelines and maintain professional discourse

### GitHub Discussions

For structured, long-form updates on project direction, features, and community topics.

**How to use:**

- **Q&A**. Ask technical questions and get community support.
- **General updates**. Follow project announcements and community updates.
- **Show and tell**: Share your MCP integrations and projects.

### GitHub Issues

For bug reports, feature tracking, and actionable development tasks.

**How to use:**

- Submit SEP proposals (following the [SEP guidelines](./sep-guidelines))
- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps
- Track development tasks and progress

### Security Issues

**Do not post security issues publicly.** Instead:

1. Use the private security reporting process. For protocol-level security issues, send a note to `security@modelcontextprotocol.io` with the details.
2. Contact lead and/or core maintainers directly.
3. Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

## Decision Records

All MCP decisions are documented and captured in public channels.

- **Technical decisions**. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues) and SEPs. Specification changes published [on the Model Context Protocol website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
- **Process changes**. [Community documentation.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance)
- **Governance decisions and updates**. [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions).

When documenting decisions, we will retain as much context as possible:

- Background context and motivation
- Options that were considered
- Rationale for the chosen approach
- Implementation steps
- How success will be measured
