MCP servers are specialized packages that you can connect to your AI applications. Each server is designed for a specific purpose - you might have a file system server for working with documents, an email server for managing messages, or a travel server for booking trips. When you connect a server to your AI app, it gains new abilities.

## What Servers Provide

There are three essential building blocks that work together in a server:

| Building Block | What It Does                                   | Who Controls It        | Real-World Example                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resources**  | Gives AI access to information                 | Application-controlled | Documents, calendars, emails, weather data                   |
| **Prompts**    | Provides ready-made templates for common tasks | User-controlled        | "Plan a vacation", "Summarize my meetings", "Draft an email" |
| **Tools**      | Lets AI take actions for you (with permission) | Model-controlled       | Search flights, send messages, create calendar events        |

Let's explore each of these using our vacation planning example to see how they work together.

## Resources: Giving AI Access to Information

Resources are how MCP lets AI assistants understand context without you having to copy and paste everything manually. They're like giving the AI "read access" to relevant information.

**In our vacation example**, resources might include:

- Your calendar (to check when you're free)
- Weather forecasts for destinations
- Travel blogs and guides you've saved
- Your previous trip itineraries
- Restaurant recommendations from friends

### How Resources Work

Instead of manually telling the AI "I'm free from June 15-22, and last year I went to Barcelona, and my friend recommended this great restaurant in Paris...", resources let the AI access this information directly (with your permission, of course).

Resources can be:

- **Static**: Specific files or data (like "Barcelona Trip Notes.pdf")
- **Dynamic**: Patterns that fetch information on demand (like "weather://forecast/{city}/{date}" for any city's weather)

### Smart Discovery with Auto-completion

When working with resource templates, MCP helps you fill in the parameters. For example, if a travel server has a template like `hotel://search/{city}/{date}`, as you type the city name "Par...", it might suggest "Paris" or "Park City" from available destinations. Similarly, for `email://inbox/{sender}`, typing "Joh..." could auto-complete to "John Smith" or "Johnson Hotels" based on your actual emails. This works just like auto-complete in file explorers or email apps, helping you quickly access the exact resource you need.

### User Interaction Model

Resources in MCP are designed to be application-driven, with different apps choosing how to present them based on their design. For example, applications might:

- **File Explorer Style**: Show resources in a familiar folder tree structure
- **Search Interface**: Provide a search bar with filters and categories
- **Smart Suggestions**: Automatically recommend relevant resources based on your current conversation
- **Context Panels**: Display available resources in a sidebar that updates based on the topic
- **Quick Access**: Pin frequently used resources for one-click access

This flexibility means each app can create the best experience for its users, whether that's a minimalist interface or a feature-rich browser.

## Prompts: Ready-Made Templates for Common Tasks

Prompts are like having an expert assistant who knows exactly what questions to ask and what information to gather for specific tasks. Instead of figuring out how to phrase your request perfectly, prompts provide proven templates.

**In our vacation example**, prompts might include:

- **"Show weather for [city]"** - Asks about the city to check there weather for.
- **"Create daily schedule"** - Organizes activities, restaurants, and transportation

### How Prompts Save Time

Without prompts, you might spend time typing: "I want to plan a vacation sometime in June, somewhere warm but not too hot, with good food, and I have about $3000 to spend..."

With prompts, you simply select "Plan a vacation" and fill in the blanks as the AI guides you through each important consideration.

### Argument Completion

Prompts get even better with auto-completion. When you select a prompt like "Show weather", MCP helps you complete the arguments. As you type "Show weather for Par...", it might suggest "Paris, France" or "Park City, Utah". Similarly, with "Send email to Joh...", it could auto-complete to "John Smith" from your contacts. This works just like search suggestions in your favorite apps, making it easy to provide the right information quickly.

### User Interaction Model

Prompts are designed to be user-controlled, appearing in ways that feel natural within each application. Common implementations include:

- **Slash Commands**: Type "/" in a chat to see available prompts like "/plan-vacation" or "/summarize"
- **Action Buttons**: Quick-access buttons in the toolbar for frequent tasks
- **Context Menus**: Right-click on content to see relevant prompts
- **Command Palette**: Press a hotkey to open a searchable list of all prompts
- **Smart Suggestions**: The app suggests relevant prompts based on your current activity

This user-controlled approach ensures you're always in charge of when and how to use prompts, making them feel like natural extensions of the app rather than automated features.

## Tools: Letting AI Take Action (With Your Permission)

Tools transform AI from an advisor into an assistant that can actually do things for you. They're the "write access" that lets AI interact with your digital world—always with your explicit permission.

**In our vacation example**, tools might:

- **Search for flights** across multiple websites
- **Check hotel availability** for your dates
- **Add events** to your calendar
- **Send emails** to travel companions
- **Create documents** like itineraries or packing lists
- **Set reminders** for important travel tasks

### User Interaction Model

Since tools can take actions, they're designed with extra care for user control and transparency. Applications typically show tools through:

- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear pop-ups showing exactly what the tool will do before it runs
- **Action Previews**: See a summary of the action with all parameters filled in
- **Permission Settings**: Configure which tools can run automatically vs. requiring approval
- **Activity Feed**: A log showing all tool executions with timestamps and results
- **Grouped Approvals**: Approve multiple related actions at once (e.g., "Search all flight comparison sites")

The key is transparency—you should always understand what's happening and maintain control over your digital environment.

## How It All Works Together

The real power of MCP comes from combining resources, prompts, and tools. Let's see our complete vacation planning flow:

1. **You select the prompt**: "Plan a vacation"

2. **AI accesses resources** to understand context:

   - Checks your calendar for available dates
   - Reviews weather patterns for potential destinations
   - Looks at travel guides you've saved

3. **You provide prompt arguments** with auto-completion help:

   - Destination: "Barcelona" (auto-completed from "Bar...")
   - Dates: "June 15-22" (auto-suggested from calendar availability)
   - Budget: "$3000"
   - The prompt then executes a complete workflow for planning your trip

4. **AI uses tools** to help (with your permission):

   - Searches for flight options
   - Compares hotel prices and availability
   - Creates a day-by-day itinerary
   - Adds trip dates to your calendar
   - Drafts an email to invite friends

5. **Result**: Your vacation is researched, planned, and organized—all while you maintained control over every decision.
