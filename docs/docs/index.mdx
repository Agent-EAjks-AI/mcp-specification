# Model Context Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP enables seamless integration between AI assistants and external tools, data sources, and services.

## Motivation

MCP unlocks powerful capabilities for AI assistants by providing:

- **Universal Tool Integration**: Connect any AI client to diverse tools and data sources
- **Secure Context Sharing**: Enable assistants to access relevant information while maintaining security
- **Extensible Architecture**: Build custom integrations tailored to your specific workflows
- **Standardized Protocol**: Use a consistent interface across different AI systems and tools

## High-Level Architecture

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:

- **MCP Clients** (AI assistants, applications) connect to multiple MCP servers
- **MCP Servers** expose tools, resources, and prompts to clients
- **Transports** handle secure communication between clients and servers
- **Capabilities** define what functionality each server provides
