## Introduction

### Purpose and Scope

The Model Context Protocol specification defines baseline requirements for core
functionality. Extensions provide additional capabilities that implementations
may adopt to support specific use cases beyond the baseline requirements.

### Extension Design Principles

To ensure extensions integrate seamlessly with the core protocol while maintaining
flexibility for diverse implementation needs, all extensions must adhere to the
following architectural principles:

1. **Independence**: Extensions MUST provide complete specifications that can be
   implemented independently without dependencies on other extensions.
2. **Composability**: Extensions MUST be modular such that multiple extensions
   can be composed together within a single implementation without conflicts.

### Extension Conformance Model

Implementations **MAY** choose to adopt one or more extensions based on their
specific requirements. Once an extension is adopted, implementations **MUST**
conform to all requirements specified in that extension.

### Extension Governance

Extensions defined within this directory follow established MCP governance and
review processes.

Implementations **MAY** define additional extensions outside of this
specification. Such extensions are not subject to MCP governance processes. The
design, maintenance, and interoperability of external extensions are the
responsibility of their respective communities.

### Available Extensions

The following extensions are currently available:

- **[OAuth Client Credentials Extension](./specifications/auth-client-credentials.mdx)** -
  Enables machine-to-machine authentication without user interaction using OAuth
  2.1 Client Credentials flow
